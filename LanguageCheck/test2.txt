"Step away from the horse," he repeated with a menacing smile. "What have we here? A
horse and saddlebags belonging to another and yet you eye them greedily and paw through
them. Is that honourable?"
Pimply slowly slipped a hand inside his overcoat and glanced at the butcher. The butcher
gave a nod and signalled toward the crowd, out of which stepped two strong, close cropped,
youths. Both carried heavy clubs, like those used to stun animals in the slaughterhouse.
"Who are you?" demanded the pimply-faced man, whose hand remained hidden inside his
overcoat, "to tell us what is and isn't honourable?"
"That's none of your business, my dear."
"You carry no weapons."
"That's true," the stranger's smile grew even more poisonous, "I don't carry weapons."
"That's no good," pimply drew a long knife out from inside his coat, "Too bad for you you're
not armed."
The butcher also drew a blade; a long hunting knife. The other two men approached,
brandishing their clubs.
"I don't carry weapons," responded the stranger, not budging, "but I'm always armed."
From behind the ruins, two young women stepped out lightly and confidently. The crowd
quickly parted, retreated then thinned out.
The girls smiled, flashing their teeth, and blinked. They had blue stripes tattooed from the
corners of their eyes to the tips of their ears. Lynx pelt clad their strong muscles from thigh to
hip and their bare arms curved above their mail gauntlets. From behind the mail-clad
shoulder of each rose the hilt of a sabre.
Pimply got down on one knee and slowly, very slowly, placed his knife on the ground.
From the hole in ruins came a rumble of stones, grinding, and then from the darkness there
emerged two hands clutching the jagged edge of the wall. Following the hands, a white head
appeared, the hair powdered with brick dust, a pale face and then, finally, shoulders, above
which stood the hilt of a sword. A murmur escaped the crowd.
The alabaster-haired man straightened and pulled a strange shape from the hole; a small, odd
looking body covered in dust and blood. Holding the beast by its long lizard-like tail, the man
tossed it to the feet of the burgrave without a word. The burgrave jumped backwards and

tripped on a fragment of wall, his eyes glued to a curved bird-like beak, webbed crescent-
shaped wings and claws like sickles on its scaly feet. Its slashed throat, once carmine, was

now a dirty red-brown. Its sunken eyes were glassy.
"Here's the basilisk," said the white-haired man as he brushed the dust from his trousers, "As
agreed, that'll be 200 lintars, good ones, not too worn. I will check them, I'm warning you."
With shaking hands, the burgrave produced a large purse. The white-haired man looked
around at the townsfolk, his gaze resting on the pimply-faced man, his discarded knife at his
feet. He also noticed the man in the brown tunic and the young women in the lynx pelts.
"It's always the same," he said as he took the purse from the burgrave's nervous hands, "I risk
my neck for a few measly coins and you, meanwhile, try to rob me. You people never
change, damn you to hell!"
"We haven't touched your bags," the butcher muttered, backing away. The men armed with
the clubs had long since hidden themselves in the crowd. "Your things have not been
disturbed, sir"
"I'm glad to hear it," the white-haired man smiled. At the sight of his smile, which bloomed
on his pale face like an open wound, the crowd began to disperse. "And that is why, brother,
you have nothing to worry about. Go in peace. But go quickly."
Pimply, backing away, was about to run. The spots stood out on his pallid face making him
look even more hideous.
"Hey! Wait a minute!" called the man in the brown tunic, "You've forgotten about
something."
"What's that... sir?"
"You pulled a knife on me."
The tallest of the young women, who stood waiting with her long legs apart, turned on her
hip. Her sabre, drawn faster than the eye could see, cut through the air. The head of the
pimply-faced man flew upwards, tracing an arc before disappearing into the gaping hole. His
body rolled stiff and heavy, like a freshly felled tree, amongst the broken rubble. The crowd
cried out in unison. The second girl, her hand on the hilt of her sabre, turned agilely, covering
her back. It was unnecessary - the crowd rushed and stumbled through the ruins towards the
town as fast as their legs could carry them. At the head of the crowd, leaping impressively,
was the burgrave - slightly ahead of the butcher.
"A beautiful strike," commented the white-haired man coldly as he shielded his eyes from the
sun with a black-gloved hand. "A beautiful strike from a Zerricanian sabre. I humbly bow
before the skill and beauty of free warrior women. I am Geralt of Rivia."
"And I..." the unknown man indicated to a faded coat of arms emblazoned on his brown tunic
representing three black birds aligned on a field of gold, "I am Borch, also called Three
Jackdaws. And these are my bodyguards Tea and Vea. At least that's what I call them
because their true names are a tongue twister. They are both, as you so finely guessed,
Zerricanian."
"Thanks to them, or so it would seem, I still have my horse and belongings. My thanks to
you, warriors, and also to you, noble lord."
